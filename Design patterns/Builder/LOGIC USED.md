LOGIC USED; 

the attributes are initialized in an  outer class called phone
ive created a constructor which takes all the functions as parameters and i wanted to print the values so ive overriden the values using toString.
ive created a builder class where all the functions are copied from outter class and created setter methods returning the value
ive created a method of type phone where it returns all the attributes
the builder class is then instanciated and parameters are passed in that object
