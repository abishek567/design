FACADE EXPLANATION;
facade is a way where the complexity of the code is been hidden by using a sequence of ceating class and data typrs inside class.

LOGIC;
in the main class there is only one implementation and a method from that class.
the method withdrawcash() checks all the required values and gives the out with a decision maker.
the class bankaccount imports all the values that withdrawcash() method needed by creating a constructor that takes the most important values as parameter.
we could get this simplicity by using this constructor and instanciating the other classes in this constructor.
and the parameters passed in constructor is obtained by getter mathod.
